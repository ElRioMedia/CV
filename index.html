  <h3>Web Development and Design Experience</h3>
  <p>The El Rio Media website is built on the Wix platform and is done so in the visual-based Editor mode. I have experience building and working on various Wordpress blogs and websites over the years too. I position myself and the builds to be more
    to the artistic/design side, rather than the large database driven type websites. I do have experience with coding on an array of different platform and languages, from HTML to audio and visual programming languages, and even languages used to
    interface sensor technology. Coding is something I know you are looking for, and Iâ€™m picking this up again now to add to my arsenal and level up my work. I have started a course on Udemy, which will lead me through HTML and CSS in the first
    phase, so I would be able to apply this to our work. This is an area of great interest to me, and am very much looking forward to the challenge. I must be clear, I do have experience having built a website just using HTML, but this was a few
    years back now, I am just picking this up full-time from now, so Iâ€™m not fluent today, but I am capable and driven to learn. (See Appendix for a list of Programs I have experience using coding)</p>

  <h3>Video Editing Experience</h3>
  <p>For my previous music business (Fraktion Music Ltd.), I was running a record label where I designed artwork, built my websites, made music and recorded/edited video for all of this. I used iMovie for Mac to edit my video content. I created
    tutorial videos, Idents, film-maker style Vlogs for YouTube, and promo audio music clip video content for Social Media. I have also taken courses in creating video content for YouTube with The Jumpcut Academy, and have some experience and loose
    understanding of the film-making process from this.</p>

  <hr>
  <h3>Graphic Design</h3>
  <p>For my graphic design work I have been using Inkscape for vector graphics and GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program) for raster graphics. In the portfolio section of my website you can see evidence of recent works for logo design and branding for
    some of my clients and some of my own previous works in the music business. I also use Canva to create different media types for brand building work and Social media. I use PlaceIt, to create my mock-ups for presenting branding on other mediums,
    like T-shirts, computers and mobile phones etc.</p>

  <hr>
  <h3>Adobe Suite</h3>
  <p>I have not used the Adobe Suite specifically yet, but I do have a good understanding of the fundamentals for graphic design and video editing etcâ€¦ so I will be able to transfer these skills efficiently and quickly to the Adobe Suite when
    required.</p>

  <hr>
  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>I have a genuine interest in what you are all working towards at ... and would love to be a part of it. I am a team player, I have personality and I make things happen. I am a creative, a director, an artist, a music producer, a chef, a sound
    engineer, I can do graphic design, video editing, website building, and a lot more. As a creative artist I am trained to think conceptually and love problem solving. This role sounds fantastic and it would be a pleasure to work with you.</p>
